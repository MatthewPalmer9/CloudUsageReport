# Google Cloud
To use Google Cloud and deploy, I first needed to create a free tier account. From the main menu, I scrolled down and clicked on "Compute Engine". At this time, I have created an Virtual Machine instance of Ubuntu where my first move is to open my VM terminal and perform updates to it with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`.
